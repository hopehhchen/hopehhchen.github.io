title: Journey Through Space and Time in Molecular Clouds I. Hierarchical Density Structures and Turbulent Distribution
---

(Peer-reviewed article published on *Astrophysical Journal*, which can be found at [this link]([https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/aabaf6).)

The density of our Universe ranges from < 0.01 particles per cubic centimeter in the diffuse interstellar medium to 10$^{23}$ particles within a star.  Most of the physical processes leading to the formation of stars occurs in the density range above 100 particles per cubic centimeter, when the interstellar medium becomes dominated by molecules instead of atoms.  To study star formation, astronomers have developed techniques to trace the cold molecules (from 10 K to no more than 100 K) in the *molecular cloud*, or what is often known as the "cradle of stars."

Like the cloud in the sky on Planet Earth, the micro-scale physical processes that lead to the formation of molecular gas and dust grains in a molecular cloud is stochastic and dominated by turbulent motions.  The overall structure of a molecular cloud is thus largely self-similar and hierarchical in nature.  That is, at size scales ranging from a few tens of parsecs (1 pc = 3.26 lightyears) to $\gtrsim$ 0.1 pc, the statistical properties of the substructures inside a molecular cloud can be roughly assumed to stay constant.  However, global effects such as gravity and local effects such as feedback from forming and newly formed stars can make different parts of the molecular cloud look drastically different.  For example, in the molecular cloud in Ophiuchus shown in the [previous post]({% post_url 2019-04-01-Hello-World %}), the western part (on the right side of the image) has much stronger star formation activities than the cloud's eastern end (toward the left of the image).  External effects, such as *stellar winds* from neighboring star clusters, may also be at work in the formation of substructures, and thus star formation activities, in a molecular cloud.

***Unfortunately, past analyses of molecular cloud substructures and star formation activities focus either on the overall property of the cloud or on the local star forming sites, but rarely both at the same time.***  The reason is inherent in the two fundamental factors of astronomical observations: the **resolution** and the **dynamic range**.  The observations done in the 1970s and 1980s, when a modern star formation theory was being formalized, were limited in resolution such that they were sensitive to structures on or larger than a size scale of 1 pc.  Meanwhile, attempts to observe clouds closer in distance to us, for which a telescope could achieve a better physical resolution with the same angular resolution, were limited in the dynamic range such that they were sensitive only to the brighter and usually denser spots in molecular clouds.  As a result, astronomers have either focused on the overall property of a cloud (or *clumps*, which are substructures with sizes around/larger than 1 pc) or on the star formation activities within individual star forming regions embedded in the molecular cloud.

*The dendrogram algorithm, using the `astrodendro` package as an example.  The two parameters that define the merging criterion are `min_npix`, pointing to the minimum size of a structure to be considered in the dendrogram, and `min_delta`, pointing to the minimum difference in the value--here the density/column density--for a structure to considered independent from the underlying density distribution.  A third parameter, `min_value`, defines the minimum value in the distribution above which the algorithm will apply itself.*

Efforts have been made since the 2000s to observe the molecular cloud and its substructures using near-infrared extinction (the amount of background starlight blocked out by the cloud), far-infrared and millimeter emission (light emitted by the cold dust grains in the cloud) and emission from molecular line transitions (light emitted by various species of molecules in the cloud).  In particular, in the late 2000s and the early 2010s, observations made with *Herschel Space Observatory* made it possible to cover the entire molecular cloud with a consistent angular resolution of 30 arcsec (corresponding to 0.02 pc at the distance of the molecular cloud in Ophiuchus) with a sufficient dynamic range that is sensitive to both the diffuse component at the outer edge of the cloud and the densest star forming substructures embedded in the cloud.  However, few attempts had been made before the publication of this work to systematically analyze the hierarchical structures across the cloud and the local variations at the same time.

*L1689 in Ophiuchus, a star forming site with varying degrees of star formation activities.  The colored regions correspond to the colored PDFs in the dendrogram-PDF plot below.  Each of these regions is a dendrogram leaf, meaning that it is considered an independent density structure based on the merging criterion defined when running the dendrogram decompositon.*

In this work, my collaborators and I combine a structure decomposition method, the *dendrogram*, with a statistical method, the *probability density distribution* (PDF), in an effort to systematically analyze the spatial density distribution of a molecular cloud consistently across all size scales.  The dendrogram (composed of *dendro-*, "tree", and *-gram*, "picture, diagram") decomposes an N-dimensional distribution of a continuous value by defining a merging criterion.  The merging criterion specifies the size of a structure and the *contrast* in value between a structure and its surroundings for the structure to be included in the dendrogram and/or to be considered an independent structure.  Eventually, as one repetitively applies a consistent merging criterion across the distribution, in this case of the density, one can construct a dendrogram that resembles a tree (with branches and leaves) and mathematically describes the hierarchical (and nested) density structures by removing the information on absolute spatial positions and focusing on the relative density "connections."

*PDFs of each substructures identified by the dendrogram, plotted on top of the dendrogram tree.  The colored PDFs correspond to regions--dendrogram leaves--shown in the figure above.  The PL, short for power-law, and LN, short for log-normal, marks are used to indicate what the underlying probability distributions may be.  A power-law distribution is usually connected to the region being dominated by gravitational infall; a log-normal distribution is usually linked to a turbulence-dominated region.*

By combining the dendrogram with the PDF of the density, which is often used as an indicator of gravitational collapse that leads to star formation, we identify subregions with various degrees of star formation activities and explore how they correlate with their *parent structure* (a structure that is a lower branch on the dendrogram and hosts more than one independent substructure) and their *sibling structures* (substructures that belong to the same "parent structure").  ***We find that previous studies using the density PDF of entire clouds as a measurement of the gravitational effect were biased by local variations in density distribution.***  By examining the correlation between the density PDF of dendrogram structures with different sizes and the velocity dispersion measurements using molecular line observations, we also learn that the local density distribution is closely related to the property of the turbulent motions.  ***With the study carried out in this project, we see for the first time how the density PDF varies across different size scales among nested, hierarchical structures within a molecular cloud.***

*Density PDF of the entire region, explained by different components used in conventional analyses to link the PDF to different physical processes.  Our analysis shows that the PDF in fact consists of subregions with different properties.  For example, the power-law "tail," which is usually linked to gravitational infall, is the result of a superposition of regions dominated by either gravity or turbulence.*

To make future study using a similar method easier, I built a tree diagram plugin for the GUI-based interactive data exploration and visualization software, [*Glue*]([http://glueviz.org/).  The plugin has been published with the release of v0.15.1 of *Glue* and allows visualization and exploration of dendrograms and other network diagrams.  *The plugin has also been tested with network diagrams constructed from medical imaging data and has the potential to help research in disciplines outside astronomy.*


*The journey through space and time in molecular clouds continues with our discovery of strange structures with minimal amount of turbulent motions that no previous theoretical works expected.*
