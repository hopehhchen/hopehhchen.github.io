title: Hello World!
---

Hello, world.  In this blog I'm going to share snippets of some of the most interesting projects I have been working on.  An astronomer by training, I have worked across the entire spectrum from data processing and cleaning to data analysis, visualization and presentation.  I love data, finding patterns in data, and being challenged with complex and even arbitrary datasets.  I also love cats and cinema.

I'll leave this false-color infrared image of my favorite corner of the Universe---the molecular cloud in Ophiuchus---here as a teaser of what is to come.  Stay tuned, world!
